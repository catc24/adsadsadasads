  <p style="font-size:11px;color:blue;">Our self-given mandate on Breaking Bad was, we were going to take the good guy and turn him into the bad guy. We're going to evolve him. And we didn't set out to do that, per se, with Better Call Saul and yet in a sense, this is where we find ourselves. One of the first things that we talked about is: Saul is funny to laugh at, but is he someone you want to be beside, a champion. Go with God. I think getting to know him as a younger person and seeing the things he's working against makes you root for him. Oh to be nineteen again! With me ladies and gentlemen? He has ambition and puts everything he's got into everything he does. Lawyers... We're like health insurance, you hope you never need it, but man oh man, not having it... No! He's got a chip on his shoulder and he has some bad instincts. He's a bit of a scoundrel, but we love him for it somehow. The show offers this really interesting look at brotherhood. Chuck McGill, played by the wonderful Michael McKean, is Jimmy's older brother. He's a brilliant lawyer. Do good work and the clients... The clients will come. Yeah, I know. He's a man who truly believes that you get ahead by doing good. The money is beside the point. The money is not beside the point. The money is the point. Jimmy has leaned on Chuck and needed Chuck's assistance in the past. Chuck is someone that Jimmy craves respect from. He's just a winner. And yet when we meet him, he does not seem to be at the heights of success. You know I'm going to get better. That leads to a very interesting dynamic. Howard Hamlin is blessed by life. The sun shines on him, the glass is half full. He runs Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. Hamlin Hamlin McGill was kind of like the Evil Empire and Jimmy's mine. They're gonna love you, Howard. You're so down to earth. And this guy in his own way is everything Jimmy is not. In our line of work, you can get so caught up that you forget to listen to your heart. The character Patrick plays is not written to be hated, but I just think you can't help it. Kim is a lawyer at the Hamlin firm. She started out there in the mailroom. I think she is ambitious. I don't think she puts on airs, but I certainly think that she is someone different at the office than she is when you see her casually. Couldn't you just... You know I can't. Jimmy's on her side, but he also sort of sees her as like, well, you went on ahead of me and he resents that status. We suspect Jimmy wants more from their relationship than he's getting. Three dollars. I'm validated. Well gee, that's swell. Mike Ehrmentraut is on our show, played as always by the delightful Jonathan Banks. As we meet them, you have a contentious relationship. Why is Mike working as a parking attendant? It's a wonderful tease, that's what it is. It's the opposite of the origin for Mike that one would expect. Jimmy has no idea, the person he's arguing with. Now you either pay the three dollars, or you go back inside and you get an additional sticker. He's just a pain in the ass. Employee of the month over here! Underdog characters are characters we can all relate to because we all feel we spend most of our times there.</p>

Well, the clock is gone on this piece, Christine, so... [Gasps] Oh, my goodness! Well, let's just move on. Well, from time to time, people make mistakes... That's okay. This is our first renoir of the evening. This is a heliogravure, which is an etching. It was hand-pulled from a copper plate in Paris in 1919. We know this because that's what it says on the back, where the certificate of authenticity is located. Just as lovely as can be. Look at the soft, delicate shading. Very feminine. This is a limited edition. This is what you're looking for if you are a Renoir fan. 100... Oh, my goodness. Right at the buzzer. Whoo! Good. Man: ...of the few exceptions is the African pancake tortoise, which has a flat, flexible shell that allows it to hide in rock crevasses. Big swath of light to moderate snow from the broken bow area down toward Kearney, Hastings, Grand Island... That is all moving in our direction. So I do think, around 7:00 to 8:00, the snow will become pretty steady here across the region with all this moving on top of us, and that's really gonna knock down visibilities. And, again, snow-covered roads are gonna be definitely likely this evening, making it even slippier... Or more... [Sighs] More slippery than it is out there at this time. There's that winter-weather advisory in effect until very early tomorrow morning. We're gonna talk snowfall totals coming up after more news. [Dramatic music plays] Reporter: Will bitter, cold weather help break up the compaction issues we created this fall in our fields? Well, we'll show you where it will and where it won't during today's iron talk. [Chair creaking] When it comes to compaction... There's really two different types of compaction. There's vertical compaction, and there's horizontal compaction. And there's a big difference. [Clattering] With horizontal compaction, there really isn't much hope for help from a freeze thaw. And the reason why, as that hard, compacted layer swells And then, in the spring, thaws back out and settles back down. There's really no breaking up of the compaction. With a vertical zone, when compaction swells out, and then it breaks up in the spring, then you can actually get a little bit of help. So if you have some horizontal compaction... [VCR whirring] created by doing some tillage when it was a little too wet, or... [Ice clinking] [Beeping] ["The battle hymn of the Republic" plays] Saul: Don't let false allegations bully you into an unfair fight. Hi, I'm Saul Goodman, and I will do the fighting for you. No charge is too big for me. When legal forces have you cornered, better call Saul! [Beeping] [Jingle plays] I'll get your case dismissed. I'll give you the defense you deserve. Why? Because I'm Saul Goodman, attorney-at-law. I investigate, advocate, persuade, and, most importantly, win! [Echoing] Win...Win...Win! Better call Saul. [Beeping] ["God bless America" plays] Do you feel doomed? Have opponents of freedom wrongly intimidated you? Maybe they told you that you're in serious trouble and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm Saul Goodman, and I'm here to tell you that they're wrong. It's never too late for justice. Better call... [Clock ticking] [Chair creaks] [Man coughs] [Chair creaks] [Ice rattles] [Slurping] [Man coughs] [Chair creaks] [Chair creaks] [Keys jingling] [Clears throat] [Hinges creaks] Jimmy: Think back... Your brain... I... It's just not all there yet. Uh, if we were all held responsible [claps hands] For what we did when we were 19... [Chuckles] I remember what it was like to be a kid. Think back. [Chuckles] Tell 'em, judge, what would you say? [Door creaks] These boys... 19. I can't... I don't... These three young men... [Sighs] Just like you. Just like you. Psst! [Sighing] [Doors creak] [Sighing] [Hinges creak] [Claps hands] Oh, to be 19 again... You with me, ladies and gentlemen? Do you remember 19? Let me tell you... The juices are flowing. The red corpuscles are corpuscling, the grass is green, and it's soft, and summer's gonna last forever. [Chuckles, inhales sharply] Now, do you remember? Yeah, you do. [Clears throat] But if you're being honest... I mean, well, really honest, you'll recall that you also had an underdeveloped 19-year-old brain. Me, personally, I... It... If I were held accountable for some of the stupid decisions I made when I was 19... [chuckling] Oh, boy, wow. And I bet if we were in church right now, I'd get a big "amen!" Which brings us to these three... Now, these three knuckleheads... And I'm sorry, boys, but that's what you are... They did a dumb thing. We're not denying that. However, I would like you to remember two salient facts. Fact one... Nobody got hurt, not a soul. Very important to keep that in mind. Fact two... Now, the prosecution keeps bandying this term "criminal trespass." Mr. Spinowzo, the property owner, admitted to us that he keeps most portions of his business open to the public both day and night. So, trespassing? [Clicks tongue] That's a bit of a reach... Don't you think, Dave? [Chuckles, inhales sharply] Here's what I know... These three young men, near honors students all, were feeling their oats one Saturday night, and they just... Went a little bananas. [Chuckles] I don't know. Call me crazy, but I don't think they deserve to have their bright futures ruined by a momentary, minute, never-to-be-repeated lapse of judgment. Ladies and gentlemen, you're bigger than that. [Man sniffs] [Woman coughs] [Sniffs] [Chairs creaking] [Woman clears throat] [Wheels squeaking] [VCR whirring] [Clattering] Kenny: [Laughs] Young man: Kenny, Kenny, are you rolling? Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute. Yeah, baby, yeah! But, dude... but, dude, pipe down. Chill out, would you? Hey, Mrs. Watson's fourth-period biology class, this one's for you. Watch and learn, losers. Oh, yeah! [Laughs] [Rhythmic squishing] Ohh! Oh, God! Dude! Where did all the bl*od go?! Young man 2: Dude, he's dead. They suck it all out, dumbass. [Laughing] Awesome. Where do they put it? All right, g... I'm though the neck bone now, dude. Oh, nice. Kenny, get over here, man. I'm... I'm getting it. Get... Get... Get this out of here. All right. All right, fine. Here, let me do it. [Laughs] I got it! All right. Oh, oh-oh! Get that. All right. Oh, my God. Ohh! Here, let me do it. Dude, get off! Chill out. [Laughter] All right. Wait, wait. Ohh. Ohh. Okay, wait for it. Wait. Ohh! [Laughs] [Laughter] Yeah! Oh! Whoo! Whoo! Come on! Yeah, baby, yeah! This dude was... Dude, I dare you to stick your wang in the throat hole. I will if you will, loser. Oh! All right, all right! [Laughter] What the hell kind of math is that? Woman: $700 per defense. No, no, no. "Defendant." "...dant." Three defendants, $2,100, which, by the way, bargain... What I did for them. They going to jail, ain't they? So, since when does that matter?! They... They had sex with a head! Look, didn't nobody tell you to try all three of them together. One trial... $700. You're gonna miss me. You are gonna miss me. 'Cause it'll be a cold day in hell before I do any more P.D. Work for this shitty court! Sayonara, baby! You have yourself a nice day. [Scoffs] [Beep] [Wand warbles] [Sighing] [Telephone rings] [Breathing deeply] [Cellphone ringing] [Groans] [High-pitched British accent] Law offices of James Mcgill. How may I direct your call? [Clears throat] Yes, Mrs. Kettleman, so good of you to return. Actually, I don't have Mr. Mcgill at the moment, but I know he'd... Oh, splendid. Uh, unfortunately, our offices are being painted and the fumes are quite horrid. Um, uh, could he meet you and your husband at, say, uh, Loyola's Cafe on Central? 4:00 it shall be. Cheers. [Breathing heavily] [Exhales sharply] [Car door creaks] [Car door slams] [Engine turns over] [Tires screech] [Brakes squeal] [Gear clicks] [Sniffs] [Clears throat] $3. Uh, I'm validated. See the stickers? Well, I see five stickers. You're one shy. It's $3. [Sighs] They gave me... Look. I'm validated for the entire day, okay? Five stickers, six stickers... I don't know from stickers because I was in that court back there saving people's lives, so... Well, gee, that's swell. And thank you for restoring my faith in the judicial system. Now you either pay the $3, or you go back inside and you get an additional sticker. Son of a bitch. [Scoffs] Fine. You win. Hooray for you. [Scoffs] Backing up! I have to back up! I need more stickers! Don't have enough stickers! Thank you! Thank you... Very nice! [Brakes squeal] [Engine shuts off] [Car door slams] Employee of the month over here! Yeah! [Clapping hands] Hooray! Give him a medal! Don't do anything, guys. Just relax, all right? Well, I'm just fuzzy as to why you think he needs a lawyer. I mean, Craig, the way you run your office is beyond reproach. Yeah. Yeah. Beyond reproach. Yeah. I'm a stickler, you know, for... He is. He's a stickler with the money. He's definitely a stickler. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's certainly not guilty of some... Is certainly not. He's innocent of any wrongdoing. That's abundantly clear to me. And frankly, I don't go looking for guilty people to represent. I mean [chuckling] who needs that aggravation, right? Right. [Laughter] Look, all I know is what I read in the paper. And typically, when money goes missing from the county treasury... And the number here is, uh, $1.6 million... Well, that's an accounting... It's an accounting discrepancy. It's a discrepancy, absolutely. But typically, when that happens, the police look at the treasurer. And since that person is, uh... [chuckles] I just think a little proactivity may be in order. Well... You know, I just think I'd look guilty if I hired a lawyer. Yeah. No. Actually, it's getting arrested that makes people look guilty, even the innocent ones, and innocent people get arrested every day. And they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he's their best friend. "Talk to me," he says. Uh, "help me clear this thing up. You don't need a lawyer... Only guilty people need lawyers." And boom! Hey, that's when it all goes south. That's when you want someone in your corner, someone who will fight tooth and nail. [Sighs] Lawyers... You know, we're like health insurance. You hope you never need it. But, man, oh, man, not having it... No. [Chuckles, exhales sharply] How [clears throat] would we proceed if we decided to, uh... Oh, well, this is a... [clears throat] Letter of engagement. It's very simple, straightforward. Please, uh, read it closely, but if you sign it, um, I can get started on that defense strategy of ours this very afternoon. [Sighs] [Indistinct conversations] [Click echoes] [Distorted conversations in distance] [Gulps] [Thud] Craig... I think maybe we should sleep on it. Uh... Sure. Don't you think, Mr. Mcgill? Maybe we should sleep on it. Oh, oh, please, call me "Jimmy." [Chuckles] A... Absolutely. I mean, there's no rush. You... Oh, and, you know, Craig, we got to pick up the kids... Oh. Right. Yeah... At the...Yeah. Right. [Chuckles] Well, uh, we will be in touch. Oh. Uh, thank you for the coffee and for the advice. You're very, very welcome. Oh! [Snaps fingers] Um, here. Take this. It's, uh... It's got my phone number on it. Yeah. Okay. Got it. [Indistinct conversations] [Sighing] The number is 9456-0054-4896-0643, and the expiration is 11/04. Okay, and the keyword here is "classy," all right? Super classy... Use only flowers that look expensive, but, you know, aren't. Uh, and the note should say [Sighs] "Dear Betsy and Craig," uh, "best wishes from your stickler for justice", James Mcgill." Okay? And "Mcgill" is spelled "m-c..." Well, run it again. Oh, no, no, no. It's paid up. Run it again. Oh! [Thud] [Brakes squeal] [Gasping] [Inhales sharply] Oh... Lars: Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, my God! Ohh. Cal, Cal! Look at me! Buddy, look at me. Are you okay? Say something. What did you do? I did... What did you do to my brother? Why don't you look where you're going?! I was making a turn! He came out of nowhere! You freaking hit him, man! You ran him over! [Coughing] You ran over my brother! And I got the whole thing on video. It was an accident. It was an accident. He didn't... he didn't mean to. Let me just... Aah! Aah! Oh! No, no. That's broke. That's broke. You broke his leg. It's my leg. Why are you driving around and not looking?! Driving around, breaking people's legs! It's... It's o... Okay, okay, okay! Where's the... Somebody call the cops! Don't call... don't call the police. Don't call the police. Cal: Lars. Ipolicía! Don't, don't, don't. Don't call them. I'll call them myself. I'm doing it myself. Don't call the police. Don't call the police. Don't call the cops? No. How you gonna fix this? What are you gonna do to make things right? [Breathing heavily] I don't know, fellas. [Sighs] What can I do to make it right? [Sighs] [Panting] I don't know. $500. 500 bucks? Yeah? Mm-hmm. Ow! What the hell, man?! Listen, starlight express, I'm gonna give you a 9.6 for technique, 0.0 for choice of v*ctim. I'm a lawyer. [Laughs] Furthermore, does... Does this steaming pile of crap scream "payday" to you, huh?! The only way that entire car is worth 500 bucks is if there's a $300 hooker sitting in it. Now, let's talk about what you owe me for the windshield. You... what? [Grunts] [Dogs barking in distance] I'll take a check! [Conversations in Vietnamese] [Man singing in native language] [Bell jingles] Chao chi c'ung, ladies! Chao chi c'ung! Chao chi c'ung! [All speaking vietnamese] Chao chi c'ung, Mrs. Nguyen. My, don't you look... Got my mail? You work for people who have sex with chopped-off head? Was it in the paper? I heard it from my cousin. Why? Why you work for these people? [Clears throat] Just lucky, I guess. Cucumber water for customer only! [Washing machine rumbling] [Door closes] [Keys jingling] [Lock turns] [Door scraping] [Keys jingle] [Sighing] [Sighs] [Dial tone] [Ringing] Female voice: You have... Zero messages. [Button clicks] [Sighs] [Sighs] [Sighs] [Tones play] [Elevator doors open] [Inhales deeply] [Button clicks] [Tones play] [Indistinct conversations] [Telephones ringing] Oh. Brenda, looking good. Nice do. Uh, where's Lord Vader? Uh, he's not quite ready for you yet. South conference room. How about you wait out here? How about I don't? [Scoffs] Oh, Sir Francis. James. Well-groomed, as always. Okay. All right. [Clears throat] Keith, Karen, yes. [Claps hands] [Inhales deeply] You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin, and I won't have it! Brenda: Do you want me to call security? It's okay, Brenda, we got it. [Button clicks] Hey, Jack. Hey, Nate. Hey, Aaron. What can we do for you, Jimmy? I'm sorry. It's... It's this table. Something just comes over me. You can tell me what this, uh, $26,000 is supposed to be for. That's money for Chuck. Isn't that what you wanted? A measly 26 grand? [Scoffs] Jesus, you're like Peter Minuit with the Indians. Throw in some beads and shells while you're at it. It's just a start. There'll be more... Unless you're gonna just tear them all up. And why was it made out to me... Why not Chuck? Can he make his way to the bank? [Inhales sharply] I just assumed it was best to have the money go through you. We can do it any way you want. This isn't going away, Howard. What Chuck did for this firm... And damn near single-handedly... 1/3 of this place belongs to him. Yeah. What do you got... 12 chairs here? Four of these chairs are Chuck's. You got five of these light thingumajigs? Uh, mm, 1 2/3 are Chuck's. Yeah. Six... How many danishes... Six danishes? You can have all the Danish you want, Jimmy. No, no. They're Chuck's danishes, and Chuck isn't greedy, so h-he'll just take two... Plus $17 million... In that ballpark. I mean, we'll know once we get the accountants poking around here. Until then, no more penny-ante checks designed to make it look like Chuck still works here. He doesn't. He never will again. It's time to do right by him and cash him out. So, these are Chuck's own wishes that you're conveying? This is what's best for him. Mm. So he personally told you that it's his wish to withdraw from the firm? [Scoffs] See, that would surprise me. It's been nearly a year since he's set foot in here. I'm just doing what's in his best interests. So am I. And I, for one, believe he's gonna lick this thing. Until then, his office is just as he left it. His secretary's still on payroll. If Chuck can call this an extended sabbatical, then so can we... He's that important to us. You know what? Let's let a jury figure it out. [Sighs] Yeah, they're gonna love you, Howard. You're so down-to-earth and relatable. And you... Will... Atone! It's Ned b*at, from "Network." For Christ's sakes, guys. [Indistinct conversations] [Telephones ringing] Jimmy. I almost forgot... This month's filings. You could save me the postage. W... Weren't you listening in there? Chuck doesn't work here anymore. You think I'm gonna help you establish a paper trail? Now, Jimmy... No, stop trying to pawn that shit off on him. Jimmy. You know, Jimmy, sometimes, in our line of work, you can get so... Caught up in the idea of winning that you forget to listen to your heart. Give Chuck my love, would you? [Scoffs] Oh, there you are. Betsy, Craig. Craig: Ah. Betsy: Hi. Okay. [Indistinct conversation] [Laughter] [Conversation continues] You look lovely today. Oh, thank you so much. [Conversation continues] [Tones plays] [Sighs] Couldn't you just... You know, I can't. [Sighs] [Breathing heavily] [Sighs] [Insects chirping] [Brakes squeal] [Gear clicks] [Engine shuts off] [Keys jingling] [Keys jingling] [Typewriter keys clacking] [Door closes] [Clattering] Aah! Son of a bitch! Chuck: Ground yourself? Yes, I grounded myself. [Clacking continues] [Bell dings, carriage slides] [Clacking continues] [Gas hisses] [Bell dings, carriage slides] [Sighs] [Clacking continues] [Ice clattering] [Bell dings, carriage slides] [Clacking continues] You got to stop putting bacon on the list, 'cause that cooler's looking like a trichinosis stew. Perfect timing. [Carriage slides] Hmm. [Sighs] "Professor Brans Vogelson." Mm-hmm. "University of Helsinki"? Yeah, you're gonna have to get that translated. Into Swedish? Finnish. Finnish, uh, translating into... [Sighs] I'm sure there's someone at UNM who can do that. You do know I'm trying to start a legal practice, right? Vogelson's been working on the effects of electromagnetic fields on zebra fish... And, oh! Financial Times. [Breathes deeply] Yeah, I knew you missed it, so I figured, "what the heck?" Thank you. I know it's expensive. Here. [Clears throat] That's not... It's all right. I don't expect you to go out of pocket. I... Go ahead... Reimburse yourself. [Clicks tongue] Thanks. Hey, Chuck, um, can you not read that for a second? Can we talk? Are you all right? You look peaked. I'm fine. Please, just sit. You're not in trouble. Um... You got to cash out. You got to. Again? Really? There's no other way. I know that you don't want to hear it, but you've got to. You know I'm going to b*at this. You know I'm going to get better. Yeah, sure. [Chuckling] Well, then, there's nothing more to talk about. I will b*at this. Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci. Meaning? That's not... Meaning? That's the one about false principles, but it's not... You proceed from false principles. Your argument is built on quicksand. Therefore, it collapses. Yeah, yeah. You're not listening. [Sighs] Fine. Let's take this to its logical conclusion. [Sighs] In order to pay out my share, suppose my partners are forced to liquidate the firm. Then what? That's their problem. My clients are out in the cold. My cases are scattered to the winds. 126 people lose their jobs. What happens to your cronies in the mailroom, the assistants, the paralegals, the janitorial staff? All of them, out on the street. Your friend Kim... a promising career... over and done with. Hamlin owes you everything. You built that place single-handedly while he was out at four hills working on his bunker sh*t. Let's not exaggerate. I helped. You helped. [Scoffs] [Scoffs] All the more reason not to tear it down just for a little bit of cash. Look... Chuck, I'm going under, okay? For the third time with these bull-crap contract counsel... "Bull crap"? Bull-crap, pissant P.D. Cases at 700 bucks a sh*t. Public-defender work is some of the best experience there is. I just had a case, Chuck, with three clients... Uh, arraignments, voir dire, jury trial... The whole nine yards. You know what I took home? 700 bucks. Yeah, I might as well head down to skid row and sell plasma. You're representing people who have nowhere else to turn. The money is beside the point. Money is not beside the point... Money is the point. I keep telling you... Have patience. There are no shortcuts. Do good work, and the clients will come. The clients will come. Yeah, I know. Okay. Hand to God, I wasn't gonna say this, but you are broke. I can't carry both of us. I've been trying like hell, but I can't. [Chuckling] Well, you're saying what? You think you have to provide for me? I never asked you that. You didn't have to ask, okay? I've been doing my damnedest, but the day of reckoning is here. Soon, Chuck, you're gonna be out on the street with all the electromagnetism in the world raining down on you. Now, please, please, picture that, then tell me that money is beside the point. This is what has you all worked up? Yeah! Jimmy... There's nothing to worry about. Here. What is this? A stipend... There's gonna be one every week. $857 from Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill? I'm gonna pay them back... Every penny. I didn't want to take anything, but Howard was very insistent. And I'm gonna pay you back, too. Wait, Hamlin was here? It's not like I'm a recluse. What? He put his cellphone in the mailbox? He understands the situation. He grounded himself? Of course. And the two of you agreed that since, as everybody knows, you're going back to work any day now, that the firm should help you make ends meet. That's correct, minus the sarcasm. Hamlin's making you a chump! I'm going to get better! I'm gonna go back to work, and I'm picking up where I left off! [Sighs] [Chuckles, sighs] [Clock ticking] Sorry. Sorry, Chuck. [Inhales deeply] I understand that you're trying to look out for me, but you're missing the bigger picture. I got it. [Sighs] Speaking of which... Howard brought this. He's concerned. What? You have to admit... It could be confusing... Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill? James M. Mcgill? That's my name. I was born with it. I... Still... How about Vanguard law? Or gi... Gibraltar legal... Wait, wait. So I'm not supposed to use my name o... On Hamlin's say-so? What's he gonna do... Sue me? Nobody wants to create an adversarial situation. I'm sure Howard would gladly pay the cost of new matchbooks and so on. [Sighs] It's simply a matter of professional courtesy. [Ticking continues] Chuck, whose side are you on? There are no sides. But, Jimmy... [sighs] Wouldn't you rather build your own identity? Why ride on someone else's coattails? [Sighing] [Insects chirping] You want to dance, Howard? [Chuckles] Let's dance. Go! No, you can get closer than that, you bitch. Come on. And here it comes. There you go. Better. [Cheering in distance] How was that? It's right on here. Take a look. Still, tighter is everything. Tighter? What? T... Tighter what? I don't know. Just stand... Tighter. You know what I mean? I don't know what you mean. That sucked. We can call that a stylistic choice, I guess, if you want to... Hey, fellas. We got business. How did you find us? I know... Eerie, right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on. Give me 30 seconds. Could be the most profitable 30 seconds of your lives. [Indistinct conversations] Let me tell you about a young guy... Actually, he's about your age. He lived a long way from here in a town called Cicero, Illinois. And in Cicero, he was the man. I mean, when he strolled down the street, all the corner boys would give him the high five. All the finest babes would smile at him and hope that he would smile back. They called him "slippin' Jimmy," and everybody wanted to be his friend. "Slippin' Jimmy"? What the hell kind of name is [chuckling] that? Well, I'll tell you, now... Winters in Cicero are m*rder. [Chuckles] You guys growing up out here in the golden west... Y... You don't know, okay? I'm talking cold that'll freeze the snot right in your nose. I'm talking wind that'll cut through your jacket and carve you up like a Ginsu kn*fe. In fact, most folks in Cicero were scared of winter, but not Jimmy. Jimmy waited around all summer, and when September finally rolled around and he'd feel that first cold wind come sweeping off lake Michigan, he knew it was coming. Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa? Better... It was slip 'n fall season. Soon as it was cold enough, he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice. State street was good. Michigan Avenue was better. He'd pick his spot, wait for it to get busy, then he'd walk out on the ice, and... Boom! He would biff it so hard, people would come running from five blocks away. Yeah, but did he collect? "Did he collect?" Slippin' Jimmy had it dialed in, all right? One good fall... He'd clear 6, 8 grand. That'd keep him in old Milwaukee and Maui Wowie right through labor day. 8 grand? 8 grand. Now, see, I look at you guys, I see potential. The skateboard's a nice wrinkle... That makes it a year-round gig. And clearly, you know how to take a header, right? But I got to ask you... Your best day ever, how much did you clear? $630. $630. [Scoffs] 630 bucks. Was that for one fall? Two. Two falls in one day. [Chuckles] Even at your age, that's got to hurt. True that. All right, well, I got a job for you. How's 2 grand sound? 2 grand for one hit? One hit. Plus, you get to learn from the best. Nice boat. Yeah, discreet, like a stripper pole in a mosque. Yeah, forget the boat. Look at the car. You know what that is? I don't know. A station wagon? It's a Mercury, a 1988 Mercury sable wagon. Remember it. Burn it into your brains. You got it? It's a Mercury sable wagon, sure. Jimmy: Close your eyes. What color is it? Brown. Brown. No, it's medium sandalwood. Keep your eyes closed. How does the license plate start? 4. 4. Give those gentlemen a gold star. Betsy Kettleman's her name. Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50, she comes through here on her way to pick up her kids at Kit Carson Elementary. Now, you need a place where she's gonna slow down... Am I right? Yeah. All right. Well, there you go. She slows down. She hangs a right. You come sh**ting out of there. You do what you did to me. You go ass over teakettle. You make it a blue-ribbon special. When she gets out of the car, you're sufferin' St. Sebastian, right? You're the hammer, okay? You get in her face. You scare the bejesus out of her. Give me your phone. [Sniffs] It's kind of busy here, don't you think? [Beeping] Well, witnesses are good. [Indistinct conversation] Witnesses are pressure, all right? Now, once you've got her good and rattled, then you call for an ambulance, but really, you're calling for me. I'm number one on your speed dial, right next to your weed dealer. You call me. I hotfoot it over here. I just "happen" to be driving by. I stop to see what the trouble is, and this is the most important part... You don't know me. We've never met. You got it? Sure. Okay. Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight. We go mano a mano. You light into me, okay? Get nasty. And no touching. Leave the hair alone. But otherwise, you know, open season. Yell. Stomp. Call me a douche bag. I'm gonna play it cool, give you back some of the razzmatazz. And once she's seen the fireworks, you fold like a lawn chair... Happy ending. When do we get our money? After. After. After. You get paid when I get paid. I'm the rising tide that raises all dinghies. Now, pop quiz... What's the car? Mercury sable wagon. Baby-poop brown. Okay. Do you know me? No. No. Damn straight. Go with God. Jimmy: Well, I'm just glad I happened to be passing by. Happy to be of help, Betsy. May I call you "Betsy"? [Clears throat] Please, call me "James." Hmm. Oh, the kid will be fine. Don't worry. He just got his bell rung a little. I'll... I'll handle that. Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I wouldn't think of, uh, taking your money for this. The embezzlement case? [Engine turns over] Mm, yes, I'd... I'd be happy to talk it over. [Chuckles] Oh, shit. [Sighs] [Dialing] Two-minute warning. Two-minute warning. Got it. [Breathing heavily] [Tires screech] [Woman screams] Oh, my God! Man: What happened? [Crowd murmuring] Woman: Call 911. Oh, my God! Cal! Cal! Look at me! Are you okay?! Buddy, say something. Cal, what are you... [Groans] Come on already. What is she doing in there? I don't know. Shh. Is she making a sandwich? Where's her sense of responsibility? [Tires squeal] What? What?! Hey! What the f... Funny to run into you, Betsy. I was just, uh, strolling the neighborhood. You... You were in accident. Oh, it's... [sighing] Come on. [Breathes deeply] [Cellphone rings] [Beep] Yeah? Lars: She took off on us. She what? It was textbook, man. We were diamonds, but then she just took off. Okay, wait. She... She hit-and-run? That's what I'm saying. She bailed and wailed. O... okay. Just stay where you are. I'll come get you. No, no, no. Screw that, man. [Engine sputters] We're following her. You're... How are... You're following her how? We got our ways, yo. Okay, okay, okay, new plan... New plan. You do know me. I'm your lawyer. You got that? I'll meet you at the school. No, she's way past the school. [Engine grinding] She hooked a left on Juan tabo, and she's coming into holiday park. Okay, stay with her. When she gets where she's going, wherever that is, just don't do anything. Wait for me. Wait for what? You haven't been right even once! Slippin' Jimmy, my ass! You fell into the honeypot, kid. You get it? Hit-and-run is a felony. So what? [Scoffs] "So what?" So more money. [Engine sputtering] He says we fell in the honeypot. He says "more money." So what do we need him for? Cal? Lars? Whoever... Oh, damn it! [Dialing] [Sighs] Come on. Come on! [Ringing] [Engine sputters] Lars: Do it. Do it. Do it. Son of a bitch! [Grunts] [Engine sputtering] Come on! Come on! [Engine turns over] [Tires squealing] [Brakes squeal] [Dogs barking in distance] [Skateboards approaching] Hey. Hey, your leg. Oh, I'm gonna do this one. Okay. Hey! Aah! Aah! Hey, yo, hold up. Hey, yeah, you... What is the matter with you? You hit-and-run. You ran him over. You felonied my brother. Que pasa? Habla English. We call... We call La policia. La policia gonna be pissed. I see you hit him. Wham! Aah. You see that... That windshield? You did that. No entiendo. No entiendo. I did that. You did that to me. You did that. Now you pay. No, señor. No, señor. No entiendo. Make... make with the dinero. ¿Dinero? Dinero. Si, righteous dinero. ¿Dinero? Y... Si. Okay. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Talking about. Mijo. Let's go. [Grunting] Imijo! Is that money? Yeah. Mijo... [Speaks spanish] [Breathing heavily] Watch this step. Aah. Watch this... Watch this step. [Grunting] [Door closes] [Tires screech] Where are you? [Sighs] Holiday park. [Sniffs] Mrs. Kettleman, Betsy. What are you doing here? [Sighs] Hit-and-run? That's very serious. I can... I can mediate. It's... I represent their parents, so... Come on. Come on. [Tires screech] [Tires screech] [Car door creaks] [Breathing deeply] [Sighs, sniffs] Open up! Officer of the court! Open up in the name of the law! [Sniffs, sighs] Good afternoon. This... [Breathing heavily] [Birds chirping] [Crow caws]</i>i></p>

  <p style="font-size:11px;color:blue;"><b>Lars: He's really... it's really messed up. Hey, hello. Habla English? Hey, are you the son? Ow! Grandson. She hit... hit him while driving. My leg. El smack-o. [Speaking spanish] [Speaking spanish] Look. Look. Just a crazy old biznatch who ran over my brother. Cal: It hurts so bad. It hurts so bad. [Grunts] It hurts so bad. Look at that. Yeah, it's this one. My leg. She... she broke his leg. And then she stood on the gas. It's a hit-and-run. She... she felonied me. That's a felony. Got the whole thing... Got the whole thing right here. Ay, dios mio. Okay, hold on. Hold on. L... let me talk to her. So, start talking. Yeah, good. [Crying] Aah! Look. He can't... he can't put any pressure on it. I need to lean on you, so... I think it's... it's definitely broken. Es muy mal for my leg-o. Here. Lean up... lean up on the mantel. No, man, it really hurts. Just hang in there. Hang in there. "Muy mal"? Yeah, it's muy mal. Dude. Dude. Yes, si, problema. Shh, shh, shh! And now dos problemas. Aah! Dude! Si, d-dos big problemas. [Grunting] I don't know what you're saying, man. Dude. Si. Dude. Si. We got a real problem here... Si. Yeah, si, problema. Shh. Ay, dios mio. Ay, dios mio. [Speaking spanish] [Door closes] Hey, amigo, what are you gonna do about this leg situation? I really need to see a doctor. A doctor... doctors ain't cheap, yo. It's gonna cost. Either you or her... somebody's got to pay. [Grunts] You want money. Yes! Yeah, damn straight. Hit-and-run? It's no joke. We're... what are the cops gonna say? Cops? [Tv chatter in distance] They coming? Y... yeah, yeah, maybe. That's up to you, man. They... the cops... They can be looking at this tape anytime now. It's all up to you. [Inhales sharply] Aah! Oh, that's really bad. [Grunts] You c-called her "biznatch"? I didn't... Yeah, but whatever, man. Please, hurry it up. I'm hurting here. Show us the green, or LA policia is gonna come, and they're gonna be taking granny away! She's gonna go to jail. Do you want that? Yeah, that's right... play it smart. Okay, good. So, let's talk dollar amounts. For what you did to my... [grunts] [Both groan] No! No! Biznatch. [conversing in Spanish] [Thudding] [Conversing continues] [Thudding continues] [Door creaks] Mijo? Mijo? Mijo... Ah, si. No, abuelita. [chuckles] Ay, mijo. A-abuelita. [gasps] Oh. Bueno. si. Si. si. Si. Si. [Door closes] [Beeping] [Speed-dialing] Hi. Get over here. Uh, my abuelita's. Bring No-doze and tell Nacho to bring his van. [Beep] [Sighs] [Spits] [Knock on door] [Sighs] [Knock on door] Jimmy: Open up! Officer of the court! Open up in the name of the law! Good afternoon. This... [Breathing heavily] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm showing hands. I'm... I'm relaxed... okay?... Um, non-threatening. You move, and you're dead. Got it. Seems to be a misunderstanding. Is there, by any chance, a Betsy Kettleman here? See, I'm not sure if this is a situation where I should or should not look you in the eye. [Sighs] Sit. [Breathing heavily] Who are you? Are you with those redheaded scumbags? My name's James McGill. I'm an attorney. Uh, I got a call from some clients, uh, said something about an accident. I did not get any details. When I saw some skateboards in your front yard, I assumed they might... [Door opens] Mijo... si, si. [tv chatter in distance] [Door closes] [Dog barking in distance] Talk. I'm gonna make an educated guess what happened here. My two clients, frick and frack, the mopheads, were in a simple traffic accident, a minor Fender bender, but maybe they were on the wrong side of the street, or they didn't look both ways. It could happen to anyone. [Chuckles] My clients, exhibiting extremely poor judgment, uh, followed your grandmother to this delightful, well-tended home. [Clears throat] Now, at this juncture, I'm deducing that they said or did something that... Crossed a line, and you, with some justification... You put them in their place. [Sighs] Based on the salsa stain there, could have gone a couple ways. The bottom line... not to be morbid, but if they're dead, um, I'm guessing that I'm... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Yeah, I'm gonna go with glass half full here and say they're not. Uh, my point is, if they're still alive, why k*ll us? Why? Because of a misunderstanding? Our own stupidity? Why mess up your lovely abuelita's place? [Chuckles] Why jump to the nuclear option? See, I'm saying keep it simple. I will collect my moronic clients, and... Poof! We are gone. Neither you nor your lovely abuelita will ever lay eyes on us ever again, guaranteed... Signed, sealed, and delivered. [Breathing heavily] Assuming, you know, that they're still breathing. [Sniffs] Wow. You got a mouth on you. Thank you. Get up. That way. That way. Y... Yeah, sure. Why not? [Door creaks] [Muffled grunting] So, what... I should cut 'em loose? [Grunting continues] Oh! It was him! It was all his idea! No, no, no! Tuco: You shut up! Say what? He... he wanted to scam you. He said we could clear 2 grand, easy. [Muffled grunting] You punking me? [g*n cocks] Are you punking my abuelita? He hit his head. He doesn't know what he's saying. [Breathing heavily, grunting] For what? For what are you getting 2 grand? It was for going after your grandma, just for taking a header over her car and then b-bracing her. It was him, I swear! It was the lawyer! [Grunting continues] [Breathing heavily] [Muffled grunting] Who are you?! Why are you after me?! I can explain. It's... you're gonna laugh. It's so... I'm a lawyer. I... check my I.D., okay? But I was running a scam. On my abuelita? No, no! Not on your abuelita, not on you. There's a woman named Betsy Kettleman. I mentioned her. She's married to Craig Kettleman. He's the treasurer of Bernalillo County. I wanted his business 'cause... He stole a million and a half bucks from the county. He's gonna be indicted for embezzlement any day now. This is a good case for me... A lot of publicity. I'll get my name out, and... Anyway, I thought if I had these two run their little skateboard hustle on Mrs. Kettleman, I could, you know, rescue her. Come in, throw some oil on troubled waters, and, yeah, I'd get their business. That was the plan. But it turns out your lovely abuelita... She drives a car... [chuckles] That's a whole lot like the Kettle-mobile. So, these two geniuses ran their little stunt on the wrong one. So, joke's on me. Ha ha! I... simple as that. [Muffled grunting] [Breathing heavily] Where's he going? W.. Talk to me, okay? [Door creaks] Who do you think I am? What is he getting? [Metal clangs] I was running a scam to get a client. I made a mistake. That's all this is. Oh, geez. [Muffled grunting] Y-you don't need... That's not... I'll talk, okay? Tell me what you want to know! Who do... who do you think I am? Hey, use your words, okay? What? [Sniffs] You know what I smell? I smell lies. I smell pork. No, that's not necessary. Okay, we know you're with the heat. The question is, who? Local? FBI? No, no, no. D.E.A.?! No, I'm a lawyer. Just reach in my pocket right now... right there! Truth. [Gasps, groans] [Grunts] That is the truth! I'm a lawyer! Guys, I passed the bar! Ask me anything! Not contract law, okay? I'm down at the courts every day! People know me! I'm a known quantity... I am! Aah! I'm... I'm special agent Jeffrey Steele, FBI. FBI? FBI? I'm undercover, okay? You got me. I'm the tip of the spear, and releasing me would be the smart move. You hear that shit? I told you the business was too good. I knew it. I told you. Can I? Okay, uh, Special Agent, uh, Steele? Jeffrey A. Steele. Okay, Agent Steele, what business are we in? Business? You're investigating us, right? For what? What did we do? What do we sell? Drugs. What kind of drugs? Uh...It's title 21, schedule II through schedule V, including part "B." That's what we call them down at the bureau. It's... the task force is designated "Operation King Breaker." "King Breaker"? So... That makes me the king! Whoo-hoo! Can I? All right. The next words out of your mouth got to be the truth. You understand? Uh-huh. Who are you? I'm James Morgan McGill. I'm a lawyer. I was trolling for business, okay? That's the truth. Now, you find a Bible, I'll swear on it. Okay, what about, uh, operation, uh, King Breaker, FBI? I made it up, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know you. I don't want to. Uh, this was a mistake, oka... It's my mistake, okay? I take full and complete responsibility, but I don't know any of your names, and I got a bad case of face-blindness. You let us go, we're gonna forget this happened. Guys, we're gonna forget, right? Nod your heads. [Muffled grunting] Okay? So, if you just let us go and just... We want to just go... home. [Metal clangs] I say cut 'em loose. He said he was FBI. He admitted it. You had your wire cutters on him. He would have said anything. You really see the FBI hiring those two flaquitos? Maybe. Croaking a lawyer for no reason is bad business. He goes away, someone's gonna come look for him. They walked into my house. They disrespected my abuelita. They call her "biznatch"! [Muffled grunting] And they just walk?! Unh-unh! What about the lawyer? [Sighs] He's giving respect. Okay. "James M. McGill. A lawyer you can trust." I know how to find you, James McGill. Understand what I'm saying? Yeah. [Muffled grunting] Up. [Breathing heavily] Okay? Take him back to his car. Thank you. Uh, uh, this is... this is good. This... this is right. Thank you. Come on. [Muffled screaming] What... what... what about them? Gonzo: Come on. Yeah, right. Come on. Uh, yeah, right. [Screaming continues] Whoa. Uh... Yo, where you going? Uh, wait. Can I... can I say something? Where you going? Can you let them go? Just let them go. Are you stupid? They don't deserve to die. I put them up to it. I don't deserve to die, but they don't, either. I'm gonna skin them, like javelinas! Forget about them! They're insects! They're... hey, think about their mother. [Spits] I spit on their mama! She is a sweet little lady. She... she's a widow. She works hard all day, every day, just like her mother before her, from dawn till dusk, scrubbing the floors of rich people. She needs a cane to walk, you know? She's got arthritis. And still, she works every day. What... for herself? No. No. For them... for these two, her boys, her apples of her eye. You say they don't deserve her? Maybe so, but they're all she's got. Now...You turn them inside out, I want you to think about what happens to her. No, that's on them. They should have thought about that. When I was at your abuelita's place, you were gonna let them go. Way I see it, that's because you're tough, but you're fair. You're all about justice. That's what I'm saying... justice. These... these two shit-for-brains? These big-mouths? You... you already b*at the living hell out of them. Do you think they're ever gonna forget today? Never... 10 years from now, they're still gonna be crapping their jockeys. It's not enough. Okay, okay. Then let's talk proportionality. They're guilty... oh, agreed. [Muffled grunting] Now you have to decide, what's the right sentence? Like a judge. Like a judge. Ever hear of the code of Hammurabi... Let the punishment fit the crime, eye for an eye? Eye for an eye. You want me to blind them. [Muffled grunting] No, no. All they did was trash-talk. So I cut their tongues out! [Muffled screaming] Wait. See, I'm advising... That you make the punishment fit the crime. [Exhales sharply] Punishment fit the crime. Columbian neckties... I cut their throats, and then I pull their lying tongues through the slits! [Muffled screaming] "Biznatch"! Or you... you could give them black eyes. Black eyes? [Laughs] That ain't nothing. No-doze: That one there, homes... He already got a black eye, fool. Stop helping. Or you could sprain their ankles. Sprain? They're... they'reskateboarders, right? That... that's how they run their scam. [Scoffs] They can't skate. You... you hit them where they live. I ain't spraining nothing, bitch. I'm gonna break their arms, and I'm gonna break their legs. Arms? When... when... When did we get on to arms? Let's... I'm cutting their legs off. But... we could go that way, but...We were talking about breaking. I think we're heading in the wrong direction. Okay. Break their legs. How many legs? Two... they got two legs. One leg... each. One leg... each? They're... [sighs] One leg each, that's a total of two legs. Uh, hey, look. [Muffled shouting] They can't skateboard for six months, and they're scared of you forever. You show everybody that you are the man, but that you're fair, that you're just. [Muffled screaming] One leg each. [Muffled screaming] That's tough, but it's fair. All right, lay 'em out! I ain't got all day! It's hotter than shit out here! [Muffled screaming] Quit moving... You're only gonna make it worse! We're sorry! We're sorry! [Bone cracks] [Screaming] [Laughs] Lookit! Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah! He said he had a broke leg... Now he's got one for real! You... tell your mama you're sorry, bitch! Other one. Look... it's backwards. [Laughs] [Screaming continues] Check it out. I'm gonna do this one real clean. No! Oh, my God! No! [Bone cracks] [Laughs] Whoo! [Laughs] Walk home now, bitch! [Both crying] Shut up! Shut up! [Both groaning] [Tires screech] [Groaning] [Horn honks] [Gasping] Here you go. Here you go. Easy, easy. You... you... you... aah! Aah! Save your breath. You... you are... you are the worst lawyer, the worst lawyer ever! Hey, I just talked you down from a death sentence... Oh, my God! Oh, my! ...to six months' probation. I'm the best lawyer ever.

[Sighs] Jimmy, did you ground yourself? [Sighs] Ohh. I don't think you grounded yourself. Jesus. Jimmy, you didn't drive like this, did you? [Snoring] Oh, no. No. I knew it. [Grunts] Ohh. Ah. Oh. Aah. [Chuckles] [Breathing heavily] [Clock ticking] [Sighs] [Lawn mower running in distance] [Birds chirping] [Sighs] [Groaning] Chuck. Coffee? Yeah, thanks. You're gonna have to take it black. We're out of milk? Oh, sorry. [Sighs] Why are you in that space blanket? You brought your cellphone in here last night. It was in your pants pocket. Oh. Sorry about that. [Sighs] Where, uh... where is it? Outside... I threw it out the door. Yeah. How did I get here? Your car's not outside, so I'm assuming taxi. [Sighs] Right. Uh, the bartender... wouldn't let me drive. [Buckle jingling] [Sighs] [Sniffs, sighs] [Sighs] Why are you in that space blanket? I told you... you brought your cellphone into my house. Uh, Chuck, um, did you... [Sighs] Chuck, did you read this? Read what? Uh, this, um, this bill... did you read it? Emergency-room bill... Yeah, I may have glanced at it. It fell out of your pocket. Hey, Chuck, listen, I... I know how this looks. I'm down to my last dime, and, suddenly, I'm paying for broken legs, but... It's... it's not that. I swear. [Chuckles] This represents a good thing, ultimately. Okay. I... I'm not backsliding. This isn't slippin' Jimmy. Fine. Take off the space blanket, will you, please, Chuck? It helps. Take off the space blanket. I didn't do anything wrong. It has nothing to do with that. It was your phone. [Sighs] Take off the space blanket. Why? Take off the space blanket, Chuck. Come on. Take off the blanket. [Grunts] Thank you. [Sighs] Front yard? Mm. [Dog barking in distance] Uh, do you have any idea where it landed? No. [Sighs] [Zipper closes] [Lawn mower running in distance] [Door opens] [Door closes] [Sighs] [Grunts] [Telephone ringing] Woman: No. No. No. No. No. No. No. What do you want? Not to starve to death. What do you say? Got something for me? [urinating] [Urinal flushes] [Sniffs] [Zipper closes] [Sighs] [Water runs] It's showtime, folks. [Coins drop] [Beeping] [Indistinct conversations] [Buzzer] Globis, lawyer. I'm gonna k*ll him. "Your honor, I'm very sorry. I'll never do it again." Say what?! Just... Your honor, I'm very sorry, and I'll never do it again. Okay, Mr. Pearson, up you go. Up you go. All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! What's this? I told you a suit, remember? Told you you want to look sharp. That's a loaner, okay? I need it back. Let's go. Petty with a prior. The kid took a slice of pizza. Petty with a prior. Look, the parents are a train wreck. There's no food in the house! He was hungry! Petty with a prior. Come on! [Paper rustles] [Brakes squeal] You're light on stickers. Jimmy: Come on. $5. You serious? You got four. You need five. There's four 90-minute stickers there. You've been here 6 hours and 5 minutes. It takes 10 minutes to walk down here! $5, or you go get another sticker. [Tires screech] This makes you feel real important, huh?! Not enough stickers! More stickers! [Toilet flushes] It's showtime, folks. [Inhales sharply] It's showtime. [Indistinct conversations] Petty with a prior. [Urinal flushes] Prior will stay on his sheet for life. Petty with a prior. [Sighs] You're overcharging him. Petty with a prior. [Indistinct conversations] That lady up there... She shorts me every time, okay? This is not a me problem... This is a you problem. [Sighs] [Inhales sharply] It's showtime. [Keys jingling] What? It's from a movie. [Indistinct conversations] Hey! [Indistinct shouting] Petty with a prior. Misdemeanor shoplifting. Petty with a prior. Come on. Meet me halfway. Petty with a prior. [Sighs] I can't do it. Petty with a prior. Okay, or how about this? I plead the kid to the sheet, but you give me a continued sentence. And in six months, if he's still clean, you file for a dismissal. Come on. Is this how you want to spend your time? You can have the rest of these. [Buzzer] Berger, lawyer. Oh, Mr. Berger, we've met before, haven't we? Mr. Edison, like the inventor? I'm James McGill. I'll be your lawyer. Doesn't matter. Judge has got to see your mother. Well, do you know anybody who looks like her? No, an Uncle won't do it. Okay, so, a fire was started. We all know that. Freezing, shivering, as she is now. In fact, wrote a book about it. [Clicks tongue] To make some cookies. But because you... Given her this name... You can see that this man... Chose... A bonehead move. [Brakes squeal] [Gear clicks] Like a troll under a bridge! "You must have the stickers, or you won't pass!" Troll alert here... don't feed it! [Indistinct conversations] [Bell jingles] Chao chi c'ung, ladies. [All speaking Vietnamese] Good evening, Mrs. Nguyen. No mail. Hey, Vicki, Maggie. [Man singing in native language] [Door opens, closes] [Washing machine rumbling] [Keys jingling] [Lock turns] [Door scraping] [Sighs] [Exhales deeply] [Blows] [Dial tone] Female voice: You have...Zero messages. [Button clicks] [Sighs] [Sighs] [Desk scraping] [Sniffs] [Metal creaking] [Groans] [Sighs] [Indistinct conversations in distance] [Sighs] [Door opens] [Knock on door] [Door thuds] Customer. What? For you... a customer, waiting now. Oh, uh, sure, sure. Uh, give me a minute. [Humming] [Desk scraping] [Breathing heavily] [Exhales sharply] [Clears throat] Welcome, welcome. My office is being painted. Excuse the temporary, uh...Quarters. Wow. Cozy. Just me. [Chuckles] Tuco freaked you out, huh? It's cool. He doesn't know I'm here. So, uh... what can I do for you? I've been thinking about what you said out there in the desert. Those people that you were trying to scam... How much did they steal? Um, north of a million and a half bucks... I think. So, they have a million and a half bucks somewhere. In what, cash? I don't... well... Why are you asking me? I'm gonna rip them off. Oh. I like ripping off thieves 'cause they can't go to the cops... they have no recourse. Mm. You point me at where they have their cash... I'll pay you... a what do you call it?... A finder's fee... call it 10%, 100 large. Well, uh, why w... why would you come to me for that? You already tried ripping them off. I'm gonna finish what you started. I... I wasn't trying to rip them off. I... I just wanted their business. Okay. [Chuckles] [Sighs] I don't know where their money is. Smart guy like you could figure it out. If I know what I need to know, nobody gets hurt. We rip them off... easy money. Hey, look, I'm a lawyer, not a criminal. [Chuckles] You are sh1tting me. I crossed a line. I made a mistake. I'm not doing that again, not ever. I got between you and tuco. Do you think you'd be here now... I kept my mouth shut? And I appreciate that. I owe you. A-and if you're ever in trouble, God forbid, legal trouble, I will be there, 24-7, as a lawyer. What's your angle? No... no angle. [Chuckles] And I'm not saying anything about this to anybody. As far as I'm concerned, you're a client. This is a consultation, and everything you just told me is privileged. You rat, you die. And that, too, yes. [Pen clicks] [Pen clicks] For when you figure out you're in the game. I'm not in the game. [Door opens] I... I promise. [Indistinct conversations] [Woman singing in native language]

[Pen scratching] [Clatter] [Drawer thuds] [Buzzer] [Indistinct shouting] [Buzzer] Here's Johnny! [Laughing] Hey, I knew you'd come. [Door closes] All right. You're a sight for sore eyes. You're looking good. [Buzzer] Jimmy. Sorry you had to come all this way. It's a long way, right? It's a long way. Yeah. Sorry. Only two things I know about Albuquerque... Bugs bunny should have taken a left turn there. And give me 100 tries, I'll never be able to spell it. [Laughs] Anyway. [sighs] As you can see, I'm in a... A bit of a pickle. You certainly are. [Chuckles] Forget the property damage and as*ault charges. You face being labeled a sex offender, Jimmy. If that happens, it'll follow you for the rest of your life. That is insane, okay? Th... That is a trumped-up load of horse crap, Chuck. Come on. Is that what I tell the judge... "Trumped-up load of horse crap"? I'm not the lawyer here, okay? But it was a simple Chicago sunroof. Sex offender? That's not even remotely a... [Scoffs, sighs] Let's talk strategy, okay? 'Cause I need you to work your magic and make this whole situation go poof. You got a plan of attack? Huh? Come on. I know I haven't made it easy for you, but you are... you are the man! Right? I know you got a million legal loopholes that we can dance through... Big bag of tricks, you know? Any clever technicalities, huh? And reasonable-doubt type stuff? Come on, Chuck. I haven't seen you in what, five years? We barely hear from you. Now that you're in it up to your neck, you can't even call me yourself... you have mom call me? Mom took it upon herself to call you! I was just letting her know where I was. You didn't cry to her on the phone? What? No. You didn't cry and beg mom for help?<sub> What? Jesus! She hears what she wants to hear, okay? I'm gonna cry on a pay phone in the middle of cook county jail. Jesus! Can we... can we talk strategy here, huh? Look... [sighs] I know I'm a lousy brother. [Sniffs] I'm a lousy brother. I'm a big screw-up. And if I was just a better person, I would not only stop letting you down... You know what? I'd stop letting me down. And it's about time that I started to make both of us proud. Am I right? Guard. Wait. Chuck, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no. You can't leave me. No. If I... if I don't get out of this, my life is over! So long as you understand that. Yeah. Jimmy, if I do this... If... Do not make a fool out of me. I promise I won't. Everything you're doing, everything you're involved with... that's over. [Exhales sharply] Just tell me what to do. [Voice breaking] Whatever it is, I'll do it. Just say it. Please, Chuck? Help me. [Sighing] [Insects chirping] [Vehicles passing] [Sighing] [Dialing] [Ringing] [Telephone rings] [Beep] Kim: Hello? Jimmy: Hey. It's me. [Grunting] Jimmy? What's... uh... Jesus, what time is it? The clock says 2:00, but I think that might be Ho Chi Minh's time zone. What? What's happening? Is Chuck all right? Yeah. Chuck... Chuck is Chuck, all right? E... everything's all right. [Clears throat] I just wanted to call you. So, uh [breathes deeply] hey, what you doing? Jimmy... No. I'm not talking dirty to you. What? Wait, you think that's the only reason I would call you at this time of night? I mean, can you just give me... Give me a little bit of credit, okay? And you're not talking dirty to me, either. Okay, bye. I knew it. Uh, joking. Just... just joking, having fun with you. I am calling you tonight with quality PG phone conversation... PG-13 at worst. Uh-huh. Hand to God, you know? Uh, but, uh, if you hang up now and drive straight over, limited time only, I'm offering a free pedicure and foot bath. Is that right? Well, maybe next time. Hey, more for me.</sub>sub> [Clears throat] Uh, you're, uh, probably swamped with work anyways, what, with that big, fat, giant case falling right into your lap. Which case is that? I don't know. Some, uh, some county official or something? It was in all the papers. Craig Kettleman. Craig Kettleman, yeah! The primo client your dipwad boss stole right out from under me. Nobody stole anybody. The Kettlemans made a choice. Yeah, so did the donner party when they took that shortcut. Come on, Jimmy. Hamlin is not that bad. And I'm gonna be second chair if it ever goes to trial, so... Be happy for me. Hey, um, how much exactly did Kettleman get away with? Uh, excuse me, innocent until proven guilty? Uh, excuse me, but I'm a taxpayer in this county. I think I have a right to know. And besides, it's not like I'm his lawyer or anything. I have to go to sleep. So do you. I know you have court in the <sup>morning. He got away with $1 million, $1.6 million, at least? I'm not talking details of the case with you. Goodnight. Where do you stash all that dough? I mean, besides for buying that idiotic boat. Hello, guilty. Hanging up now. This guy's... yeah, he's probably a target. Somebody might get some bad, bad ideas. You know, if Kettleman isn't careful with that money, I mean [sighs] his whole family could be in danger. What do you mean, "danger"? Jimmy, why would you say that? What? You said the family might be in danger. I did? I... oh, I, uh... [Clears throat] I'm... I'm drunk. [Chuckles] So, I'm just, uh... I'm thinking out loud. I'm... I'm up, spinning, uh... Spinning thoughts. You sure? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh... So, I will see you down in the court bowels Mañana. Goodnight, Kim. Goodnight, Jimmy. [click] [Beep] I'm no hero. [Sighs] [Sighs] [Bed creaks] [Insects chirping] [Brakes squeal] [Beeping] [Dial tone] [Coin drops] [Dialing] [Ringing] [Click] Hello! You've reached team Kettleman! Craig: Please leave a message for Craig... Betsy: Betsy... Warren: Warren... Jo Jo: And Jo Jo... All: After the beep! [Receiver slams] [Coin rattles] [Dialing] [Ringing] [Click] Hello! You've reached team Kettleman! Craig: Please leave a mess... [Coin rattles] [Coins drop] [Dialing] [Ringing] Craig: Hello? [Muffled, distorted] Kettlemans, you're in danger. You're in danger. I'm s... I'm sorry. What? Craig, who is it? I am not sure. Wait. Say... say that again, please. Jimmy: </sup>sup>[Muffled, distorted] They know about your money. Watch out. Yeah, what are you trying to say? This is a warning. You're in danger. They're coming for your money. This is a friendly stranger. Your whole family's in danger. The money... they know about the money! You have a terrible connection. I'm warning you. They know about your money. Be careful. Do you think... Can you call back on a better line? [Normal voice] Kettlemans, you're in danger. They're coming for your money. Bye. [Receiver slams] [Coin rattles] [Clock ticking] What did he say? We're... In danger. They're coming. Who... Who's coming? Jimmy: Okay, how about this... Time served plus counseling? Oakley: Can't do it. It's his first offense. Can't do it, McGill. "Can't do it." "Can't do it." Would you work with me here? [Sighs] I'm listening, aren't I? [Buckle jingling] Well, you're kind of a captive audience. What did you eat for lunch... The whole roast beast? Oakley: Funny. [Toilet flushes] Okay. Okay. But hear me out. Wow. The 30 he's done, which is a 60 credit, plus 60 additional days. Can't do it. Best offer... six months, plus the time he's done, half time for good behavior... out in 90. That's my final. That's never gonna happen. Oh! Come on. Now, are you joking? Now, that is the best deal you're gonna get. [Air blowing] I can't do it. Your guy drove drunk into a shopping center and k*ll three people. Wait. Shopping center? Desmond Rojas. Armed robbery, liquor store. He as*ault a cashier with a bottle of Kahlúa. Oh. I was thinking of Daryl Redwood. Yeah, okay. My bad. Desmond Rojas. Okay, go. Start over. I am not starting over. I'm busting my nut here every day for 700 a throw, inhaling your B.M., which is straight from Satan's bunghole, and you can't tell one defendant from another?! 90 days with good behavior... We're doing this. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Say it. Say the words, "I accept the deal." Yeah, I... I accept... I accept the deal. [Scoffs] [Door closes] [Cellphone ringing] [Sighs] Good morning. W... what do you mean, what did I mean? I... I... no, I told you. I... I was drunk. I just... Kim, why are you... Why are you asking me this? [Tires screech] Oh, damn it. Here. I'm in a real rush. I didn't have time to<sup> get the validation. Fine. 9 bucks. [Sighs] I... I don't have it. I have $5. Please? You know the drill... Money or the validation. Look, this is an emergency, okay? A serious, serious emergency. I have to get out of here. I promise, on the souls of my forefathers, I will get you the stickers when I come back. I will get you extra if you just let me go. Fine! Fine! You're gonna make me walk back and get the stickers?! I will walk back and get the stickers! I'm not making you do anything. Those are the rules. Hey, whatever helps you sleep at night. Screw you, geezer! [Tires squeal] [Brakes squeal] [Police radio chatter] [Gear shift clicks] [Indistinct conversations] [Engine turns over] Man: Copy that, dispatch. [Keys jingle] [Engine shuts off] [Car door closes] [Indistinct conversations </sup>sup>continue] Jimmy.<sub> What brought you here? Me? Uh... Uh, I... I was surfing the police scanner. I heard there was big activity out this way. Well, there's no business for you here, so maybe next time. Uh, it was a home invasion? Uh, the Kettlemans okay? Uh, we don't know. A neighbor was walking the dog last night and saw the front door wide open. The place was ransacked. No sign of the family. There's no note, so... We're still figuring it out. I got to get back. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Good luck. [Police radio chatter continues] Why did you come here? [Scoffs] I'm just supporting a friend in her time of need. You want to be supportive? Tell me why you said those things last night. I'm just reading tea leaves, same way I knew the Kettlemans needed a lawyer. All that money floating out there... It's logical somebody would come after it. So, the same night you worry about them, they... Disappear? Yeah, it's crazy. It's "Ripley's." Jimmy, it's not just Craig and Betsy Kettleman... It's their two kids, as well. You would... Say something if you could help find them, right? I don't... I don't know what happened to them. Really, I d... I don't know. The longer you stay here, the more explaining I have to do to Hamlin. I'll talk to you later. Hey, you'll tell me if there's anything I can do? [Sighs] Everything is gonna be fine. It's gonna work out. A-okay. It's gonna be fine. [Breathes sharply] [Tires screech] [Coins rattle] [Sighs] [Coin drops] [Dialing] [Ringing] Nacho: Nacho. Leave it. [Beep] Uh, yes, I'm, uh... [Clears throat] This is the party you spoke to the other day. Uh, and I sincerely want to help you. [sighs] De-escalate your situation, uh, legally and otherwise. Um, so call me at 146-8729 at your earliest convenience.</sub> But soon, please. [Receiver clicks] [Coins rattle] [Sighing] [Coins jingle] [Coins drop] [Dialing] [Ringing] Nacho. Leave it. [Beep] Yeah, Nacho, hi. Uh... Just to clarify, look, I don't know anything. Uh, I have spoken to no one, and, uh, there are no rats on this ship. But [sighs] for the sake of everyone involved, I would just like to open a dialogue. So... 146-8729. Call me when you get this. [Receiver clicks] [Coins rattle] [Breathing heavily] [Coins rattle] If I didn't say it before, time is of the essence on this matter, so, uh, I'm gonna hang up now... If you're trying to call. Uh, there's no call waiting here if you get a busy signal. 146-8729. Just keep trying. I'll be here. [Receiver clicks] I can put out this fire, if there is a fire. By hope of hopes, this is all a big misunderstanding. 146-8729. [Coins rattle] [Sighs] [Telephone rings] Hello? Hello? Nacho? Nacho? [Click] [Dial tone] [Receiver clicks] [Sighs] [Keys jingling] [Door creaks] [Engine sputtering] [Sighs] [Engine sputtering] [Door creaks] [Exhales sharply] Walking. Just walking. Just strolling along. [Panting] [Siren chirps] [Tires screech] Oh, thank God! Help! Help! Down! Show us your hands! Stop! On the ground! Oh, you guys are cops? Show us your hands! I got bad knees! Ow! Ohh! [Grunting] Come on, officers. You're making a mistake. My name's McGill, James McGill. [Handcuffs click] I'm an attorney. Easy, easy! [Police radio chatter] It's his lawyer. Whose lawyer? [Indistinct conversations] [Telephone rings in distance] You sure he asked for me? Going in or what? [Beep] [Sighs] Hey. [Clears throat] You asked for me, and I have come. I want to tell you this was a wise move... Very smart, because I'm here to help... Everyone... All parties, but mostly you. Uh, those two detectives... [stammers] They just gave me an earful. [sighs] And what they were telling me is... it's problematic. I'm gonna pitch it back to you so I know we're on the same page. A neighbor lady saw a suspicious van parked across the street from the Kettlemans' house two nights in a row. She wrote down the license plate. It was your license plate. Cops tracked your van and you, searched it, and found bl*od on the floor. So... Here we are. [Smacks lips] Um... Um... They're calling the FBI in on this, which makes it federal. That's a bad thing, Nacho. That's... that's very bad, but if you tell me where the family is, if... if you give them up now... Full cooperation, deep remorse... I feel very good about knocking your sentence down to the minimum... 18 years. [Chuckles nervously] They take this good-behavior thing very seriously, so start here, right here. [Sighs] Tell me the family is okay. Tell me the kids are okay. Y... you want to tell me your thoughts and weigh in? Does this sound like a plan that you can get behind? You miserable piece of shit. You set me up. I what? You gave my score to another crew, and now you're setting me up. I... what the what? D... did the cops b*at you? 'Cause you're talking like a person with head trauma. You think you're funny? What are you saying? Are you saying that you had nothing to do with this? That was your van outside the house. Y... you weren't there? Yeah, I was there. I was casing the place, figuring out the best way in and out, what time they went to bed... all that. They were fine when I left. That's it. You had nothing to do with the Kettlemans? I was never in the house. [Scoffs] What about the bl*od in your van? They DNA my ride, all they're gonna find is the bl*od of your skate-rat twins, plus whatever piss and shit you leaked out when you were in there. Nobody's been in the back of that van since. [Sighs] I... I don't understand. Here's what I understand, counselor. I told my plan to one other person. One... you. Now here I am, under arrest. Go figure. [Sighs] I don't know anything about a setup or another crew. [Chuckles] [Chains rattle] You know what? I don't even care. The cops are out there right now, poking into my business, and if they find something on me or my partners, for real, it's gonna be bad for you... really bad. Bad? Bad as in... You get me out of here, today... Or you're a dead man. [Knock on door] [Beep] Oh, hey. I asked if you knew anything. You didn't tell me you were representing the lead suspect. I didn't know it at the time. Dunst: He give up anything? What? Did he tell you where the family is? [Sighs] H... he doesn't know. What does that mean... he doesn't know? He gave them to somebody else? He... he doesn't know because he didn't do it. Ah, Christ. Give me a break. Guys, can you give us just a minute? Jimmy, that family is in real danger. You don't have to stand behind attorney-client privilege. I'm not. These people can be buried in a box, sucking air through a straw right now. And I'm sorry if that's where they are, but my guy didn't do it. How are you so sure? [Sighs] You know what you're gonna do? You're gonna get your special CSI people, right? And you're gonna test the bl*od from that van, because I guarantee you, one billion percent, it's not the Kettlemans'. Whose is it? I... It's not the Kettlemans'. Just test it. That'll take weeks, if we could even get a DNA sample to compare it to. Well, isn't that convenient? You've got an innocent man in there right now, who I demand you release with an apology! Dunst: Look, there are no other suspects. There's no evidence that points to anyone else. Well, then, I want to see the crime scene, 'cause you guys are missing something. Screw you, "missing something." No, detectives, I, um... I think that's a good idea. A good idea? Yes. I think we should invite Mr. McGill to the house. [Scoffs] Why? Yeah, why? So, what did we miss? [Clock ticking] [Sighs] This is the son's room... Warren. 12 years old. [Sighs] Jo Jo's room. She's 7. [Sighs] All right, you wanted me to crack? Mission accomplished. But I'm telling you... My client didn't do this. We know Varga was outside the house the night the family disappeared. That is a fact. Advocate for the guy all you want after we get these people back safe. In the meantime, help us. Where's the doll? Where's the what? Uh, got little shoes, a bunch of clothes, a table and chairs, hairbrush, but where's the doll that goes with all this stuff? In every picture of this little girl, she's holding the same doll. So, where's the doll? What does it matter? Doll is gone... girl is gone, which means doll and girl are most likely together, which means... I have no idea what that means. Which means the kid wasn't dragged out of the house. Ipso facto... Wait. Wait. What are you saying? Maybe the Kettlemans kidnapped themselves. That's it. You're... You're... you're done. Let's go. I... it makes perfect sense. How does it make sense? Why would they do that? They stole a million dollars-plus, right? You... you want to get away with all that yummy cash, what do you do? Run? No, you can't. If you run, everyone knows you're guilty. Ah! But if you're kidnapped, you're a v*ctim, right? They staged this to throw everyone off. [Scoffs] You guys are looking in the wrong place. Who knows how many miles into Mexico or Canada they could be? You... you got to put the word out. Oh, co... come on. You don't think it's possible I'm right? It's possible... unlikely. Unlikely? All their cars are here. There's no record of a taxi or car service to the house, and they didn't get on any planes or buses or trains. You checked all that? Yes, we checked it. And the doll... it's not news. We saw it was missing. So where is it? The girl was scared, crying. Bad guy lets the kid take the doll to shut her up. What? You don't think that's possible? I need to talk to you alone. I've got to tell you something on the Q.T., and promise not to be upset with me. No way am I making that promise. I called the Kettlemans. After I hung up with you, I gave them a warning call. A warning call? Yeah, I was worried my guy Varga was going after their money. And he was. He was gonna rip them off. I deduced it from a conversation that we had. It was lawyer to client, so there was, you know, confidentiality issues. But I called the Kettlemans anonymously to warn them. Anonymously? You didn't... oh, God, you didn't... You didn't do the sex-robot voice, did you? I did, with the tube and the whole thing, which probably scared the living shit out of them, and they took off, which, you know, file that under "unintended consequences," but you... you believe me now? Uh... Great. Now we have to find them. I mean... or, better yet, get the cops to let Varga go because right now my ass is on a highway to the danger zone. Well, why are you in danger? Nacho Varga... he didn't kidnap the family. But he's a bad guy. He's a very bad guy. And if the cops keep pushing him, they're gonna find something. And when that happens, Nacho blames me, and then his guys turn me into a meat piñata. Jimmy, tell the police. No, there's n... there's no way I'm gonna rat on this guy. I will never be safe. No, I have to convince the cops that I'm right, get them to stop looking at Nacho, and catch the Kettlemans on the run. And if they never catch them? The Kettlemans? Well, you've met these people, right? They're... they're not exactly masterminds, right? They will be caught if the cops are looking for them, so you tell them to, would you? The FBI, too... I heard they're getting in on this. Why would the FBI listen to me? Well, Hamlin... They'll listen to him, right? APD, at least. Y... You... you talk to Howard. You explain things to him. He has clout with these people. What? Is... is that a no or... Hamlin will never agree to it. The Kettlemans are our clients. This would mean incriminating them. Oh, you... you see? This is why people hate lawyers. [scoffs] It's Hamlin's call, and Hamlin will never agree. And even if it were up to me, you know I couldn't. I'm sorry. I just... I get it. Where are you going? I'm gonna go talk to Nacho. I'll try to make him see reason. To beg! [Brakes squeal] [Beep] Come on. Come on! [Button clicking] [Sniffs] Right. Yeah. Hey. [Clears throat] I was a jerk, okay? So, I will... I will pay you what I owe you, plus interest, if you just let me come through. I suggest you find parking somewhere else. Somewhere else, as in... Where somewhere else? Not my concern. Uh, actually, uh, this is your job, so, by definition, it's your concern. So pump out the ticket and open the stupid gate already, please. I mean, I don't have time for this. [Horn honks] [Scoffs] All... [sighs] All right! [Horn honking] Hey. I'm gonna... I'm gonna park right here. I don't think you want to be doing that. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? You got a poop-filled diaper in there? Are you gonna throw it at me? You gonna gum me to death, huh, geezer? Ohh! Whoa, ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ohh! Ohh! Ow! Ow! We're talking about a family... Mom, dad, two kids. Lawyer's got this bullshit theory about them staging this and running off with the money. You know the story? Yeah, county treasurer embezzled funds. I read the paper. Yeah, well, we got this gangbanger dead to rights. Only problem is your guy over there. He needs to help us get his scumbag client to talk. So, what do you say? You on board? Help us do some good. Sure. Okay, here's the deal... You as*ault this man. Give me a break. I barely touched the guy. But you laid hands on him first. Finger... I laid finger on him. Well, whatever your interpretation, it was still an as*ault. Now, this gentleman is willing to let this go, not press charges, if you help us out. You got to get your client to tell us where he has the family stashed. Wait, guys, I'm the definition of a broken record on this one. Nacho is "not-cho" man, comprendo? Nobody took the Kettlemans. The Kettlemans took themselves! You're gonna keep playing that line, it's gonna go rough. [Sighs] You know what? Do your worst. All right, let's go... to booking. Yeah, sure. Fine. [Claps hands] Perfect end to a perfect day. Hey, guys, wait a second. I changed my mind. I'm sorry. What? I don't want to press charges. We talked about this. You want to press charges. No. No, I don't. What are you doing, buddy? I thought you had our backs. No, I don't think I said that, buddy. So, what... you get a chance to do the right thing and you puss out? Mm... Yeah. Well, I guess it's my loss. Hey, Cagney, Lacey. When you realize how wrong you are about all this, I'll take an edible arrangement as a "sorry." Heavy on the pineapple. [Sighs] Hey. Hold up. How come you let me off the hook back there? Look, I'm going back to work. Why don't you quit while you're ahead and go on your way? No, I refuse to believe it's because you have something resembling a heart inside your body. You're not gonna have a heart inside your body in about five seconds. Okay, don't tell me, all right? I already know why you did it. Yeah? Why is that? 'Cause you believe me. That family kidnapped themselves. [Chuckles, clicks tongue] All right, I believe you. I knew it! I knew it! Finally, someone believes me! [Laughs] W... why do you believe me? I heard the details. Your story makes sense. Of course it does! But... [snaps fingers] Devil's advocate... like the cops said, uh, the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house. There's no record of them leaving. H... how'd they get out of the country? They didn't. Odds are, they didn't get out of their neighborhood. What? What? They... come again? Look [sighs] when I was still on the job back in Philly, we had this case... Whoa, hold up. [chuckling] Hold up. Now, wait. "On the job," as in you were a cop on the job? This bookie disappeared after the super bowl... Cowboys/steelers... took $6 million in bets and skipped town when things didn't go his way. Now, everybody thought he was on the beach in the Bahamas or dead in the Jersey pine barrens... wasn't the case. He was two doors down from where he lived in a foreclosed house. Hid there for six months without anyone suspecting. But... but why? Why not run? Now, that's what everybody expects. It's human nature to want to stay close to home, and if this Kettleman figured out how to do it, that's what he did. Nobody wants to leave home.
